1. **Content alignment** with your actual product (reverse osmosis, fluoride removal, aluminum cans)
2. **Legal compliance** (Privacy Policy, TOS, Cookies)
3. **Complete functionality** (working order buttons, more neighborhood data)
4. **E-commerce preparation** (product pages, shopping system)

**Overall Assessment**: 7/10 - Good foundation, needs content updates and feature completion.

## 🔍 Detailed Code Analysis

### **What's Working Excellently** ⭐

1. **Landing Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)**
   - 496 lines of well-organized code
   - Responsive design with mobile menu
   - Smooth animations using Framer Motion
   - Clear section structure (Hero, Features, Products, Testimonials, CTA)
   - Good use of Tailwind CSS
   - Accessibility considerations

2. **Map Page (`src/app/map/page.tsx`)**
   - 342 lines of complex functionality
   - Interactive Leaflet map with dynamic imports (prevents SSR issues)
   - Color-coded neighborhoods by water quality (0-10 scale)
   - Sliding panel with neighborhood details
   - Chart visualization using Recharts
   - Mobile-responsive design
   - Smart state management

3. **API Route (`src/app/api/neighborhoods/route.ts`)**
   - Clean, simple implementation
   - Handles both GET and POST requests
   - Proper error handling
   - TypeScript typed

4. **UI Components**
   - Professional Shadcn/ui components
   - Consistent styling
   - Accessible (using Radix UI primitives)
   - Reusable and well-typed

### **What Needs Immediate Attention** ⚠️

1. **Metadata (Critical)**
   ```typescript
   // Current (WRONG):
   title: "Create Next App"
   description: "Generated by create next app"
   lang: "en"
   
   // Should be:
   title: "AquaPure - Чиста Вода без Микропластмаси и Флуорид"
   description: "Премиум вода с обратна осмоза..."
   lang: "bg"
   ```

2. **Content Mismatch (Important)**
   - Current text talks about "natural springs" and "7-step purification"
   - Doesn't mention: reverse osmosis, fluoride removal, microplastics, aluminum cans, remineralization
   - Generic copy doesn't reflect your unique value proposition

3. **Broken Links (Important)**
   ```typescript
   // Lines 487-488 in page.tsx:
   <Link href="#">Политика за Поверителност</Link>  // ❌ Goes nowhere
   <Link href="#">Общи Условия</Link>                // ❌ Goes nowhere
   ```

4. **Non-functional Buttons (Medium)**
   - All "Поръчай" (Order) buttons do nothing
   - "Научи Повече" (Learn More) button does nothing
   - Should either work or show "Coming Soon"

5. **Limited Data (Medium)**
   - Only 1 neighborhood has actual data in JSON
   - Map looks empty without more coverage
   - Need at least 10-15 neighborhoods for Varna

### **What's Missing** ❌

1. **Legal Pages** (Critical for EU/GDPR)
   - Privacy Policy
   - Terms of Service
   - Cookies Policy
   - Legal Notice

2. **Product System** (Important)
   - Individual product detail pages
   - No product information beyond basic cards
   - No shopping cart
   - No checkout process
   - No payment integration

3. **Additional Pages** (Important)
   - About Us (standalone page)
   - Contact page with form
   - FAQ page
   - Science/Technology explanation page

4. **Features** (Nice to have)
   - Cookie consent banner
   - Newsletter signup
   - Social media links
   - Blog/articles section
   - Customer dashboard/accounts

## 💡 Final Thoughts

You have a **solid foundation** built with modern, professional tools. The code quality is good, and the design is clean. The main gaps are:

1. Content that matches your actual product
2. Legal compliance
3. Complete functionality (e-commerce)

The good news: **All of these are fixable** and there are no major technical problems. With focused effort, you can have a professional, compliant website live in 1-2 weeks.

**My Recommendation**: 
- Week 1: Quick fixes + legal pages (launch information site)
- Week 2-4: Product pages + content
- Month 2-3: E-commerce functionality

This gives you a professional presence quickly while building out full features systematically.

---

**Good luck with your project!** 🚀💧

The water quality mission is important, and your technical foundation is strong. Focus on quick wins first, then build systematically. You've got this!
